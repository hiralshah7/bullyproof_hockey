            Parent support and behavior play a crucial role in minor hockey. Hockey is not just a sport, it's also a learning experience that teaches children life skills such as teamwork, sportsmanship, and dedication. Parents play a key role in fostering a positive environment that enables children to develop these skills.

            When parents provide emotional support, encourage healthy competition, and model good sportsmanship, they help create a positive experience for their children. Additionally, parents who demonstrate respect towards coaches, referees, and other players help establish an environment where children feel comfortable and confident. On the other hand, negative behaviors such as shouting at officials, arguing with other parents, or criticizing children can undermine the positive experience and create unnecessary stress for the children.
            
            It's important for parents to understand that their behavior affects their children. By setting a positive example and fostering an inclusive environment, parents can help their children develop a love for the sport and a commitment to being their best both on and off the ice.
